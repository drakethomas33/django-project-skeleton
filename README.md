django-project-skeleton
=======================

My preferred Django project template, very strongly influenced by the great [twoscoops repository](https://github.com/twoscoops/django-twoscoops-project) with some slight restructuring.

In particular, this template is specifically geared towards Django apps to be run on Heroku.

The below command will create a new directory based on the project skeleton:

    django-admin.py startproject --template=https://github.com/drakethomas33/django-project-skeleton/archive/master.zip --extension=py,rst,html project

This will produce the top level directory /project/ with /project/ inside. I don't like this, so I will simply rename the top level directory:

    mv project/ new_project/

Then do the standard virtual environment stuff (note, the requirements live in a directory and the top level requirements.txt points to production.txt).

    cd new_project/

    virtualenv venv --distribute --no-site-packages

    . venv/bin/activate

    sudo pip install -r requirements/local.txt

You will need to have Postgres installed locally, on Mac OS X you should use the [Postgres App](http://postgresapp.com/). You will need to make sure your system is looking at this app:

    export PATH="/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/MacOS/bin:$PATH"

You can then create your database:

    createdb new_project

Export your DATABASE_URL setting:

    export DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost:5432/new_project

and sync your database:

    python manage.py syncdb

The two export statements above are good candidates to be put into an env_development file at the top level of your repository (not checked in!).
